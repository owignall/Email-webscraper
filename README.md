# Email-webscraper

**Version 1.0.0**

This programme is designed to return email addresses from a given website. It does this using regular expressions. The scraper will also follow any internal links it finds on the given webpage and search these for email addresses too.

The scraper can be run either through the command line - using the main scraper file - or through the graphical user interface.

Potential improvements to this project include improving the accuracy of the email and url regexes
